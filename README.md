# 3D-Render-Using-Java
A simple 3D software renderer written entirely in pure Java, without using OpenGL or any external graphics libraries. The project demonstrates how a complete 3D pipeline works under the hood by manually performing every stage of rendering — from vertex transformation to pixel shading — using only Java’s standard libraries.
